# NHSX Data Engineering Documentation

## Data Engineering repo list

We have a series of repositories for our work that we have listed below. We have adopted the naming convention of starting each repo with `au-` for the Analytics Unit. Where some repos have a similar purpose we name them similarly, (e.g. `au-azure-*` for azure related code). We also try to impliment a naming convention so that users can infer a basic understanding of what a given thing does from its name.
